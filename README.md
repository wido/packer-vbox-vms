# Virtual Box Packer Virtual Machines
This repository Virtual Machines build for Virtual Box using [Packer](https://www.packer.io/).

I use these Virtual Machines for all kinds of testing and development purposes which are mainly
focused on Ubuntu LTS systems.

Feel free to use these configuration files and/or this repository for your own use.
